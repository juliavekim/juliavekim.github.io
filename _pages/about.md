I am currently a Masters student at the University of Cambridge, studying Quantum Computing and Statistics. I recently graduated with an HBSc in Physics, Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Toronto with a 4.00/4.00 cumulative GPA and an overall average of 97.6%. My main research interests are quite eclectic, and they span quantum information, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), optimisation, and simulation. My interests in these fields have led me to take on a wide variety of research projects at the University of Toronto; currently, I am studying how to apply novel self-supervised learning techniques to JWST and APOGEE data under the supervision of [Dr Nathan R Sandford](https://nathansandford.github.io/).
