I am currently a Masters student at the University of Cambridge, studying physics and statistics. I recently graduated from the University of Toronto with a 4.00/4.00 cumulative GPA and an overall average of 97.6%. My primary research interests are Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Optimisation, Computation, and Quantum Information. My passion for these fields has led me to take on a broad number of research projects at the University of Toronto.
