I am currently a Masters student at the University of Cambridge, studying Quantum Computing and Statistics. I recently graduated with an HBSc in Physics, Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Toronto with a 4.00/4.00 cumulative GPA and an overall average of 97.6%. My main research interests are quite eclectic, and they span quantum information, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), optimisation, and simulation. My interests in these fields have led me to take on a wide variety of research projects at the University of Toronto; currently, I am studying how to apply novel self-supervised learning techniques to JWST and APOGEE data under the supervision of [Dr Nathan R Sandford](https://nathansandford.github.io/). 

What is Next? 
======
Following Cambridge, I am to begin my Ph.D. in Physics with Ph.D. minors in Statistics and Computer Science at Stanford University. At Stanford, I plan to continue to study machine learning applications, so that I can productively contribute to research in this exciting field. As I also have emerging interest in quantitative finance, I am actively developing my skills in this field, in the hopes of obtaining an internship as an ML or quantitative researcher.
